Description: VCFArray extends the DelayedArray to represent VCF data entries
    as array-like objects with on-disk / remote VCF file as backend. Almost
    all data entries from VCF files, including info fields, FORMAT fields,
    genomic location info, and the fixed columns of REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER,
    could be converted into VCFArray objects with different dimensions.
