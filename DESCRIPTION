Description: VCFArray extends the DelayedArray to represent VCF data entries
    as array-like objects with on-disk / remote VCF file as backend. Data
    entries from VCF files, including info fields, FORMAT fields, and the
    fixed columns (REF, ALT, QUAL, FILTER) could be converted into VCFArray
    instances with different dimensions.
